My name is Samuel Bolduc. Iâ€™m a solutions architect / backend developer currently working at [Tylio](https://www.tylio.com) (*go take a look!*). I love what I do and will try to reflect this in this blog, whenever I have the time to write. I am currently based around Montreal, Canada.

I have a great interest in backend development, particularly Node.js and its related ecosystem. I also love architecting systems in the cloud, mostly with AWS these days.

I will try to write blog posts I think can benefit others on specific problems and challenges I encountered and how I solved them. I also have sporadic interest in random stuff, unrelated to IT, which might spark a few posts here and there. Who knows.
